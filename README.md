# Project_unit_2

My Site Tryon-Experiences will hit these MVPs:

 All 7 restful routes were used.

 CRUD is fully functional.
 Heroku app works and all CSS is working as intended.

 My site is a tour guide site where you can find a location listed and pick between three options. Hiking, Camping, or Kayaking.

 ====================Homepage======================
 The home page is an introduction page with a few pictures and a video of Baker Lake.

 ===================NavBar=========================
 The nav bar at the top will allow you to view locations, check pricing, and log in.

 After logging in you will get a hamburger menu on the far right of the navbar. When you click there you will have the option to Manager your Account, View the cart, or check your order history.
 =====================Footer=========================
 The footer will have my social media links as well as the main resources I used. All the links on this footer work.

 =========Locations / index  page====================
 The location page will show a simple layout of all of your locations available. This will have a brief description of each location and a picture. Click on either the name of the location or image to get more information on that location.

 ===========Location info / show  page==============
 On this page, I have two carousels one with images and one with info about the location.
 I also added the same description as on the locations page. I also added a picture of a map of each location and a link using google maps.

 On this page, if you click on the hamburger menu you will see additional links. This will allow you to edit, create, and delete.

 ====================Edit  page=====================
 Here you can edit any of the locations. This is fully functional and allows you to edit all data provided on the Location/ show page.

 ===================Create  page=====================
 Allows you to create a new page and will provide you with default images if you do not add any.

 ==================Pricing  page===================
 Lists all three pricing structures. Each link takes you to a different checkout page.

 ============Checkout  page=======================
 The checkout pages will allow you to reserve a datem choose your headcount for the trip and pick the locations available for each activity.
 Your cart will update the cost of each activity and times it by the headcount submitted. It will also take into account the promo code discount. “This is hard coded due to the fact that I could not figure out the promo code in time”.
